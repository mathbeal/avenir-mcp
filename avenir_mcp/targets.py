"""A category's target: what it is, what a change sends YNAB, and what brings it back.

YNAB's API sets a target through three fields: an amount, then either a date (a
target to reach by then) or a frequency (monthly, weekly, yearly), not both. It keeps
an existing target's kind when only the amount changes. It cannot choose a kind: a
target set in the app as monthly funding, a target balance or a debt payment cannot
be recreated once replaced or removed, and undo says so before the user confirms.

Two kinds of category take fewer targets. A credit card payment category takes no
frequency, and an amount alone gives it monthly funding. A category paired to a loan
account takes neither a date nor a frequency. The API does not say which categories
are paired to a loan: one is recognised by its debt payment target, and one without a
target yet is refused by YNAB itself, after the user confirms.
