## Rôle

Split one transaction across categories, e.g. from a receipt, after the user confirms.

Give at least two lines, {amount, category_id, memo}, adding up to the
transaction's amount to the cent (amounts in currency units, negative for
spending; a refunded deposit is a positive line). Group a receipt by
category: one line per category, not per item. Transactions already split,
transfers and off-budget ones are refused. YNAB's API cannot change a split
afterwards: undo_operation cannot revert it, the user edits it in YNAB; the
user is told before confirming. Confirmation works as for apply_categories.

## Erreurs

- `Transaction {transaction_id} is not in this budget: use a transaction_id returned by suggest_categories.`
- `Transaction {tx_id} is already split: YNAB's API cannot change its lines, change them in YNAB.`
- `Transaction {tx_id} is a transfer between accounts: it cannot be split.`
- `Transaction {tx_id} is on an off-budget account: YNAB does not split those.`
- `Give at least two lines: to give the whole transaction one category, use apply_categories.`
- `The lines add up to {total}, the transaction is {amount}: they must match to the cent.`
- `A line is zero: leave it out.`
- `Category {category_id} is YNAB's internal Uncategorized: choose a real category.`
- `Category {category_id} is not in this budget: use a category_id from suggest_categories or get_category_balances.`
- `This client cannot ask the user to confirm, and AVENIR_MCP_REQUIRE_ELICITATION=1 forbids confirmation codes: nothing was changed. Use a client that supports MCP elicitation, or unset the variable.`
- `This confirmation code is unknown, expired, already used, or was issued for different changes. Call again without confirmation to get a new preview.`
- `Confirmation codes are disabled (AVENIR_MCP_REQUIRE_ELICITATION=1): call again without confirmation, and the user answers in the client.`
- `The budget changed between the preview and the answer. Call again without an answer to get a new preview.`

Les erreurs propres à YNAB reviennent sous la forme `Error calling tool '<tool>': YNAB <status>: <detail>`.
