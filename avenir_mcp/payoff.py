"""In what order, and by when, the debts would be paid off with a fixed monthly sum.

Each month, every debt is charged a twelfth of its yearly rate on its balance, then
gets its minimum payment; what is left of the monthly sum goes to the first debt of
the strategy: the highest rate first (avalanche) or the smallest balance first
(snowball). A debt paid off frees its minimum for the next. Sums are made in
milliunits; interest is rounded to the cent each month, as a lender does.
