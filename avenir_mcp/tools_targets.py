    A target YNAB tracks for the category: an amount to reach by a date (a holiday
    fund, a yearly tax), or an amount to set aside each month, week or year. Give
    either by_date or frequency, not both; with neither, an existing target keeps its
    kind and only its amount changes (a new one is monthly). No amount removes the
    target. Undo restores the previous target, except one set in YNAB's app as monthly
    funding, a target balance or a debt payment when it is replaced or removed: the
    user is told before confirming. Confirmation works as for apply_categories.

    Args:
        plan_id: YNAB plan id or 'last-used'.
        category_id: Category (from get_category_balances or list_category_groups).
        ctx: The MCP context, used to ask the user.
        amount: Target amount in currency units, greater than 0; omit to remove it.
        by_date: YYYY-MM-DD to reach the amount by.
        frequency: monthly, weekly or yearly: the amount to set aside that often.
        confirmation: Code from a previous "confirmation_required" result.

    Returns:
        The target before and after, whether undo can restore it, or an input request the
        client answers by asking the user (protocol 2026-07-28).
