"""The targets short of money in a month, the most urgent first.

YNAB computes each target's figures for the month asked: what it still needs this
month to stay on track (Underfunded in YNAB's app), what it needs over its whole
period, how far along it is. Nothing is recomputed here: the figures are sorted,
added up and set against the month's Ready to Assign. Sums are made in milliunits.
