## What it does

Set the amount budgeted ("Assigned") in a category for a month, after the user confirms.

The amount is absolute, in currency units, not a change. The result gives the
amount before and after; undo_operation restores the previous one.
Confirmation works as for apply_categories.

## Behaviour

| | |
|---|---|
| Kind | write — hidden unless `AVENIR_MCP_WRITE=1` |
| Confirmation | yes: previewed, then applied after the user agrees |
| Undo | yes, with `undo_operation` |
| Destructive | yes |
| Idempotent | yes |
| YNAB requests | 1 for the example below, on a cold cache |

## Parameters

| Name | Type | Required | Default | Description |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| `budget_id` | string | yes | — | YNAB budget UUID or 'last-used'. |
| `month` | string | yes | — | 'YYYY-MM-01' or 'current'. |
| `category_id` | string | yes | — | Category (from get_category_balances or suggest_categories). |
| `amount` | number | yes | — | New budgeted amount, in currency units. |
| `confirmation` | string \| null | no | `null` | Code from a previous "confirmation_required" result. |

## Returns

| Field | Type | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `status` | "applied" \| "confirmation_required" \| "declined" \| "nothing_to_do" | Outcome: applied, confirmation_required (nothing changed yet; pass the code back once the user agrees), declined (the user said no), or nothing_to_do. |
| `message` | string | What happened and what to do next, for the agent to relay. |
| `category_id` | string | The category changed. |
| `category` | string | Category name. |
| `month` | string | Month changed, YYYY-MM-01 ('current' is resolved). |
| `from_amount` | number | Amount budgeted before. |
| `to_amount` | number | Amount budgeted after. |
| `confirmation` | string \| null | Single-use code confirming exactly this preview, valid 10 minutes; null unless status is confirmation_required. |
| `operation_id` | string \| null | Journal id of the applied operation, for undo_operation; null unless status is applied. |

## Example

Arguments:

```json
{
  "budget_id": "demo-budget",
  "month": "2026-09-01",
  "category_id": "cat-restaurants",
  "amount": 150
}
```

Answer on the demo budget:

```json
{
  "status": "confirmation_required",
  "message": "Nothing changed yet. Budget Restaurants for 2026-09-01: 120.00 → 150.00? If the user agrees, call again with this code.",
  "category_id": "cat-restaurants",
  "category": "Restaurants",
  "month": "2026-09-01",
  "from_amount": 120.0,
  "to_amount": 150.0,
  "confirmation": "<confirmation code>",
  "operation_id": null
}
```

## Errors

- `Category {category_id} is not in this budget: use a category_id from get_category_balances.`
- `month must be 'current' or the first day of a month as YYYY-MM-01, got '{month}'.`
- `This confirmation code is unknown, expired, already used, or was issued for different changes. Call again without confirmation to get a new preview.`
- `The budget changed between the preview and the answer. Call again without an answer to get a new preview.`

YNAB's own errors come back as `Error calling tool '<tool>': YNAB <status>: <detail>`.
