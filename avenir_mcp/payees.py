"""A plan's payees: the labels banks give them, and the rename of one.

A card payment carries the date and the card number in its label, so one shop can
end up as many payees. Listing them with the merchant each label normalises to
shows which ones name the same shop; renaming one to the merchant's name fixes it
at the source, for every transaction that names it.
