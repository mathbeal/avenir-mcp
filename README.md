# avenir-mcp — an unofficial MCP server for YNAB

[![YNAB API terms: self-checked](https://github.com/mathbeal/avenir-mcp/actions/workflows/ynab-terms.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/mathbeal/avenir-mcp/actions/workflows/ynab-terms.yml)

Self-checked on every change against YNAB's API terms of 2025-05-28 (naming, attribution,
YNAB's own image, a personal token for its owner only, the hourly limit); a weekly job
turns the badge red when YNAB changes its terms. Listed by YNAB in its
[Works with YNAB](https://api.ynab.com/#works-with-ynab-third-party) directory, among
third-party apps. Not endorsed by YNAB.

Built and tested against YNAB's API v1.87.0. A weekly [`YNAB API drift`](https://github.com/mathbeal/avenir-mcp/actions/workflows/api-drift.yml) check compares it with the live specification and fails when YNAB publishes a new version.

> 🇬🇧 **avenir-mcp** (*avenir* is French for *the future*) lets an AI agent read your YNAB plan

>
> 🇫🇷 **avenir-mcp** permet à un agent IA de lire votre plan YNAB et de vous aider

Ask Claude — or any [MCP](https://modelcontextprotocol.io) client — about your plan
in plain words: where the money went, what still needs a category, whether an account
matches the bank, when money would run out. Every change is previewed, confirmed by
you, and can be undone.

All four come from the invented demo plan: the write above is replayed by `python -m docsgen`,
so every line of it is what avenir-mcp answers today; then a real reply of Claude Sonnet, and
the net worth and the forecast the documentation shows. The demo plays for thirty seconds and
holds its last frame, which tells the whole story on its own: a reader whose system asks for
less motion, or a viewer that does not animate, sees that frame instead.

## Why avenir-mcp

- **Tools for tasks, not endpoints.** Classify a month of transactions, reconcile an
  account, forecast your balance: one tool each, not a wrapper of YNAB's API.
- **Read-only by default.** Tools that change your plan exist only when you enable
  them.
- **Preview, confirm, undo.** Every write shows what will change and waits for your
  yes; `undo_operation` reverts it.
- **Answers an agent can read.** Currency units, short typed answers, pagination,
  errors that say what to fix, bank text treated as untrusted.
- **Verified.** 100 % line and branch coverage, and an evaluation where a real agent
  works on an invented plan: 25/25 tasks.

## Install

You need a YNAB personal access token
(YNAB → Account Settings → Developer Settings → New Token), and, except with the Claude
Desktop extension, [uv](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/).

[![Install in Claude Desktop](https://img.shields.io/badge/Claude_Desktop-Install_avenir--mcp-D97757?style=flat-square&logo=claude&logoColor=white)](https://github.com/mathbeal/avenir-mcp/releases/latest)
[![Install in VS Code](https://img.shields.io/badge/VS_Code-Install_avenir--mcp-0098FF?style=flat-square&logo=visualstudiocode&logoColor=white)](https://insiders.vscode.dev/redirect/mcp/install?name=avenir-mcp&inputs=%5B%7B%22id%22%3A%22ynab_token%22%2C%22type%22%3A%22promptString%22%2C%22description%22%3A%22YNAB%20personal%20access%20token%22%2C%22password%22%3Atrue%7D%5D&config=%7B%22command%22%3A%22uvx%22%2C%22args%22%3A%5B%22avenir-mcp%22%5D%2C%22env%22%3A%7B%22YNAB_API_KEY%22%3A%22%24%7Binput%3Aynab_token%7D%22%7D%7D)
[![Install in Cursor](https://cursor.com/deeplink/mcp-install-dark.svg)](https://cursor.com/en/install-mcp?name=avenir-mcp&config=eyJjb21tYW5kIjoidXZ4IiwiYXJncyI6WyJhdmVuaXItbWNwIl0sImVudiI6eyJZTkFCX0FQSV9LRVkiOiJ5b3VyLXRva2VuIn19)

One click installs avenir-mcp **read-only**: in Claude Desktop, open the
`avenir-mcp-<version>.mcpb` of the latest release and paste your token, which the
extension keeps out of sight; VS Code asks for it in a password box and keeps it in its secret
storage; in Cursor, replace `your-token` in the server's settings. Add `AVENIR_MCP_WRITE=1`,
or tick **Allow changes to your plans** in the extension, to allow changes.

Or by hand:

```bash
# Claude Code
claude mcp add avenir-mcp --env YNAB_API_KEY=your-token --env AVENIR_MCP_WRITE=1 -- uvx avenir-mcp
```

```jsonc
// Claude Desktop, Cursor: the mcpServers block of the client's configuration
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "avenir-mcp": {
      "command": "uvx",
      "args": ["avenir-mcp"],
      "env": { "YNAB_API_KEY": "your-token", "AVENIR_MCP_WRITE": "1" }
    }
  }
}
```

Drop `AVENIR_MCP_WRITE` to stay read-only. Other clients and every option:

## What you can ask

| You ask | avenir-mcp |

| "Categorise what is pending." | `suggest_categories`, then `apply_categories` after your yes |
| "Split this receipt: 81.15 groceries, 5.25 household." | `split_transaction` — one transaction across categories, after your yes |
| "Which transaction is my 86.40 receipt from the 12th?" | `find_transactions` — by dates, exact amount and account, categorised or not |
| "My bank shows 3,440.80. Does YNAB agree?" | `reconcile_account` — explains the gap, changes nothing until it matches |

| "How much of my income do I keep?" | `get_savings_rate` — income, spending, saved and rate, month by month |
| "Which targets are behind this month?" | `get_underfunded_targets` — what each still needs, most urgent first, against Ready to Assign |
| "When will my debts be paid off if I put 500 a month on them?" | `get_debt_payoff_plan` — avalanche or snowball, the month each debt is paid off and the interest |
| "How old is my money?" | `get_age_of_money` — YNAB's Age of Money month by month, and its trend |
| "Move 30 from Tennis to Restaurants." | `set_category_budget`, previewed and undoable |

## Development

```bash
git clone https://github.com/mathbeal/avenir-mcp && cd avenir-mcp
uv sync
just check        # lint, types, tests at 100 % coverage, vocabulary, lockfile
just docs-serve   # the documentation, live
just evaluate     # a real agent on the demo plan (uses your Claude plan)
```
