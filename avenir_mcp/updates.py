"""Tell the agent, once a day at most, that a newer avenir-mcp is on PyPI.

A server pinned to a version, or started from a cached copy, never learns that a
fix was released. At start-up, unless switched off (see off), the server asks
PyPI for the latest release, remembers the answer for a day, and adds a line to its
instructions when it is behind. It never upgrades itself: the user decides, and only
they know how it was installed.
