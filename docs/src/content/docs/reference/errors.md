An error comes back as a tool result with `isError`, and its message says what to fix, so that the agent can correct its call. Placeholders in braces stand for the value that was passed.

## From YNAB

Any tool that reaches YNAB can return YNAB's own error: `Error calling tool '<tool>': YNAB <status>: <detail>` — for example `YNAB 401` for a wrong or revoked token, `YNAB 429` when the 200 requests per hour are spent. Without `YNAB_API_KEY`, the server refuses to call YNAB: `YNAB_API_KEY environment variable is not set`.
